# Introduction

This document provides an introduction the the UNFPA small area estimation application.  Small area estimation is a statistical method often used to combine high-resolution census data with 
subject-specific but lower-resolution household surveys. This application provides a user-friendlty interface for conducting a small-area estimation analysis. It includes an interface for loading numerical census 
and survey data, as well as shapefiles for display of results.  Users are directed to choose the relevant indicatorsfrom survey data, as well as variables that are common to both survey and census data as a basis for building a linear model. The application presents methods for checking the suitability of variables for modeling.  When the user has constructed a suitable model, the app allows for diagnostic testing of model results and finally prediction of the results into relevant census units. Users can export analytic steps as tabular or figure results.
