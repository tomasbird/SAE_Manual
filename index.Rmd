# Introduction

Small area estimation (SAE) is a set of statistical methods used to generate high-resolution spatial predictions from low-resolution data sources. In the context of human population characteristics, SAE methods often combine high-resolution census data with subject-specific but lower-resolution household surveys. 

This site provides an introduction the the UNFPA's small area estimation tools that have been developed to support estimation of SDG indicators from census and DHS data. At present, this includes a guide to conducting data harmonization between DHS survey and census data, and instructions for using the UNFPA's Small Area Estimation application. 

Future developments may include further tools for facilitating harmonization and indicator calculations, as well as an online version of the UNFPA's Small Area Estimation Guidance document that is the basis for the SAE tool and harmonization methods.
